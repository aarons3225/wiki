# Welcome!

My name is aaron. I have loved tinkering with electronics for a while. I have been around computers since they still used dial up, however, it's only been recent since I have taken to going more in depth. 

Around 2010, I began to look for ways to store back ups of my media library. I also loved Apple and Macs. An early solution was a WD video box that connected a hard drive to my TV. It was good but not the best and was not very compatible with Apple.

The WD player would accept all file types while iTunes only accepted mp4 and later m4v. 

I started playing around with Apple TVs and my Macbook and got it up and running through iTunes connected to the Apple TV. 

Then I discovered Plex Media Server. I fell in love and have not really looked back since. 

If you can't tell, home entertainment has been my drive behind me teaching myself hardware, software, networking, etc. 

## My knowledge

So far, all my knowledge has been self taught; either via trial and error to watching YouTube videos to following tutorials and google searching things. 

I started out with a 500 gb hard drive attached to my computer to send files through to the Apple TV after the WD player died. I then went up to a 1tb then to a 2tb, then to a 8tb. 

After that, I moved to a Qnap TVS672XT.

I then upgraded my home network from an Orbi to a Unifi UDM Pro with some Access Points and the Power Distribution Unit.

I also got myself a server and then realized it wasn't going to work out.

From there, I upgraded my rack, and got 2 smaller "servers". An Intel Nuc 11 and a zimaboard.

Now, I have recently started to take a course on YouTube for CompTIA A+. It has been very slow considering I also work 60+ hour weeks. 

## My goal

I hope to leave my current field all together and get into IT. For me, it would make me super happy to be able to do what I already do at home for fun, and get paid for it.
