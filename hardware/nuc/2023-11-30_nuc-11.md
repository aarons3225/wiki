# I just got my first NUC

So far it is awesome!!

I tried out the windows part of it, and was not the greatest fan. My intention was to utilize this as a Plex Server and I could not keep it logged on. SO I installed Ubuntu Server 23.10 and fiddled around with getting Plex up and running. So far it has been rough learning linux. However, harware wise, this is perfect as a media server.

It has a built in NVIDIA GTX 2060 GPU in it, while running an 11th Gen Intel i7 CPU. 

I bought it on Amazon and here are some of the specs:
- Core i7-1165G7
- GeForce RTX 2060 6GB
- 32GB DDR4 RAM
- 1TB PCIe SSD
- WiFi 6
- BT 5.2

Here is a link to the Amazon page:
